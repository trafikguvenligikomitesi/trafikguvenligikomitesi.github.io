## Priorities in Traffic

[![](./images/priorities.png){class="logo"}]()


## [Basic Facts by WHO](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/factsheet_1_web.pdf) (1/6)


- "About 1.25 million people globally die each year as a result of road traffic crashes—that’s over 3400 deaths a day."

- "Nearly half of those who die on the world’s roads are vulnerable road users: pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists."

- <div class="website-link">[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/factsheet_1_web.pdf](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/factsheet_1_web.pdf)</div>


## [Basic Facts by WHO](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/factsheet_1_web.pdf) (2/6)

<!--
- "Around the world, almost three times more men than women die from road traffic injuries."  
-->

- "Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death globally among people aged 15–29 years."

- ![](images/road-deaths-by-gender.png){style="width: 600px; vertical-align: middle;"}


## [Basic Facts by WHO](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/factsheet_1_web.pdf) (3/6)


- "Five key risk factors in road traffic deaths and injuries are: drinking and
  driving, speeding and failing to use motorcycle helmets, seat-belts and child
  restraints."  

- "Over 90% of the world’s road traffic fatalities occur in low- and
  middle-income countries, even though these countries have only about _half_
  the world’s vehicles."  


## [Basic Facts by WHO](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/factsheet_1_web.pdf) (4/6)

-  ![](images/number-of-deaths.png){style="height: 350px; vertical-align: middle;"}

- "Without action, annual road traffic deaths are predicted to become the
  seventh leading cause of death, by 2030."


## [Basic Facts by WHO](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/factsheet_1_web.pdf) (5/6)

[![](images/vulnerable-road-users.png){style="height: 500px; vertical-align: middle;"}](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/factsheet_1_web.pdf) 


## [Basic Facts by WHO](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/factsheet_1_web.pdf) (6/6)

- "Reducing road traffic deaths requires paying more attention to the needs of
  pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, who have so far been largely
  neglected in transport and planning policies."

- "By putting in place measures to increase safe walking and cycling,
  governments can also reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and
  traffic and achieve better health resulting from more physical activity."


## "New" Ideas for City Planning

- ["Complete Streets"](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/program/national-complete-streets-coalition/what-are-complete-streets/)

- ["Living Streets"](https://www.pps.org/blog/a-new-manual-for-living-streets/)

- ["Walkable Cities"](http://www.npr.org/2012/11/17/165239291/what-makes-a-city-walkable-and-why-it-matters)

- Examples:

    - [Los Angeles County, CA, USA](http://www.modelstreetdesignmanual.com/)

    - [Broward Country, FL, USA](http://www.browardmpo.org/index.php/44-complete-streets-initiative)


## "Complete Streets"

- [Broward County, FL, USA, Complete Streets Initiative](http://www.browardmpo.org/index.php/44-complete-streets-initiative)

    - "The Broward Complete Streets Guidelines manual is based on complete
      streets principles that aim to design streets for people of all ages and
      physical abilities and accommodate all travel modes"

- Traffic engineering, landscape architecure, transportation
  engineering, city planning, etc.

- Traffic safety written all over ...

## ["Decade of Action"](http://www.who.int/roadsafety/decade_of_action/plan/en/) (1/2)

- By WHO, covers 2011–2020

- Identifies 5 “pillars” for intervention:

    1. Road safety management
    2. Safer roads and mobility
    3. Safer vehicles
    4. Safer road users
    5. Post-crash response


## ["Decade of Action"](http://www.who.int/roadsafety/decade_of_action/plan/en/) (2/2)

- "14 MARCH 2013 | GENEVA - Only 28 countries, covering 7% of the world’s
  population, have comprehensive road safety laws on all five key risk factors:
  drinking and driving, speeding, and failing to use motorcycle helmets,
  seat-belts, and child restraints."

## Saving Lives and Eliminating Injuries

- "[The Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine
  (AAAM)](https://www.aaam.org/about/) is the premier global professional
  organization dedicated to saving lives and eliminating injuries associated
  with road traffic __crashes__. AAAM is a multi-disciplinary organization that
  promotes its mission through scientific research, authoritative educational
  programs, public policy recommendations, and pre-eminent Abbreviated Injury
  Scale (AIS) coding, training and certification."

    - [https://www.aaam.org/](https://www.aaam.org/)


## The Problem

- __CRASHES!!!__

    - Psychological losses

    - Physical losses (esp. death or permanent injury)

    - Economic losses

- Time lost and increased fuel consumption due to prolonged delay/wait times,
  environmental side-effects, stress, frustration, anger, etc. that result from
  from using the traffic system


## Societal Demand

<div class="talebimiz">TRAFFIC SAFETY</div>


## Traffic Safety System Priority

SAVING LIVES 

and 

PREVENTING SERIOUS/PERMANENT INJURIES


## What is road traffic?

__Traffic__ is the movement of road users (mostly people, but animals
at times) and goods from one location to another on roadways via vehicular
(motorized/unmotorized) travel or on foot.


## What is an "accident"/crash?

"A traffic collision, also known as a motor vehicle collision (MVC) among
others, occurs when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian,
animal, road debris, or other stationary obstruction, such as a tree or pole.
Traffic collisions may result in injury, death and property damage."

<div class="website-link">[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision)</div>


## What is road traffic safety?

"__Road traffic safety__ refers to the methods and measures used to prevent road
users from being killed or seriously injured. Typical road users include
pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, vehicle passengers, and passengers of on-road
public transport (mainly buses and trams)."

<div class="website-link">[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_safety)</div>


## What is road traffic engineering?

"__Traffic engineering__ is a branch of _civil engineering_ that uses engineering
techniques to achieve the __safe__ and __efficient__ movement of people and goods on
roadways. It focuses mainly on research for safe and efficient traffic flow,
such as road geometry, sidewalks and crosswalks, cycling infrastructure,
traffic signs, road surface markings and traffic lights. Traffic engineering
deals with the functional part of transportation system, except the
infrastructures provided."

<div class="website-link">[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_engineering_(transportation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_engineering_(transportation)) 


## What is road traffic engineering?

"__Traffic engineering__ ... deals with the planning, geometric design and
traffic operations of roads, streets and highways and their networks,
terminals, abutting lands and relationships with other modes of transportation
for the achievement of __safe__, __efficient__ and __convenient__ movement of
people and goods. __Traffic engineering__ applies engineering principles that help solve
transportation problems by considering the psychology and habits of the
transportation system users."

## ["Vision Zero, Sweden, 1997"](http://www.visionzeroinitiative.com/) (1/2)


- "The Vision Zero is the Swedish approach to road safety thinking. It can be
  summarized in one sentence: <span style="background-color: #bbffbb"> No loss
  of life is acceptable.</span> The Vision Zero approach has proven highly
  successful. It is based on the simple fact that we are human and make
  mistakes. The road system needs to keep us moving. But it must also be
  designed to protect us at every turn."

- [http://www.visionzeroinitiative.com](http://www.visionzeroinitiative.com)


## ["Vision Zero, Sweden, 1997"](http://www.visionzeroinitiative.com/) (2/2)

- __DEATH__ and __PERMANENT INJURY__ are ethically unacceptable

- __Shared__ responsibility for traffic safety 

    - __PUBLIC__: responsible
